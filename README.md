# ntwksw1.github.io
My name is Nicole Wilson.

My email address is ntwkswams@gmail.com.

ntwksw1 Github was created to use for my assignments.

Repository was created in order to use for my Web, Pgm, & Db Foundation (2024FA.CTI.110.0010) course.

After creating a Github account, I downloaded the Github software to my PC. There were options to select on the right side of the Github window so I selected "Clone Repository. The repository was cloned under my ntwksw1 account in addition to adding a ReadMe file.
